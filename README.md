# Generating Images with Stable Diffusion using Gradio

This Python script demonstrates how to create an interactive image generation application using the Stable Diffusion model and the Gradio library. The script leverages the following libraries:

- **Gradio**: A Python library for creating user-friendly web interfaces.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for image processing.
- **Torch**: A deep learning framework for building and deploying machine learning models.
- **Diffusers**: A library from Hugging Face for running diffusion models like Stable Diffusion.

## Installation

To get started, install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install gradio torch diffusers transformers accelerate
